# Simple Linear Regression
# Linear regression assumes a linear or straight line relationship between the input variables (X) and the single output variable (y).

# More specifically, that output (y) can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (X). When there is a single input variable, the method is referred to as a simple linear regression.

# In simple linear regression we can use statistics on the training data to estimate the coefficients required by the model to make predictions on new data.

# The line for a simple linear regression model can be written as:
# y = b0 + b1 * x where b0 and b1 are the coefficients we must estimate from the training data.

# Once the coefficients are known, we can use this equation to estimate output values for y given new input examples of x.

# It requires that you calculate statistical properties from the data such as mean, variance and covariance.

# All the algebra has been taken care of and we are left with some arithmetic to implement to estimate the simple linear regression coefficients.

# Briefly, we can estimate the coefficients as follows:
# B1 = sum((x(i) - mean(x)) * (y(i) - mean(y))) / sum( (x(i) - mean(x))^2 )
# B0 = mean(y) - B1 * mean(x)
# where the i refers to the value of the ith value of the input x or output y.
